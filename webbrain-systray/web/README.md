# WebBrain Companion site

A one-page site in English (`index.html`) and Turkish (`tr/index.html`). Both
pages are generated from one template so they keep the same structure:

```bash
python3 web/build.py        # writes web/index.html and web/tr/index.html
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory web
```

Everything is static: `assets/site.css`, `assets/site.js` (picks the visitor's
system for the download button and the tray illustration), the panel's own
typeface (Bricolage Grotesque, SIL OFL 1.1) and the images in `assets/img`.

## Images

The site never shows a real desktop.

- **Tray menu** (hero): drawn in HTML from the app's actual menu strings, on a
  plain plum field with one status bar. The *macOS / Windows / Linux* switch
  restyles it the way each system draws the menu.
- **Panel windows**: screenshots of the companion's panel only, taken with sample
  data (`WBC_DEMO=1`, accounts like `ada@example.com`) by `tools/shots.py`: the
  main page, adding a subscription and the Bonsai 2 27B details, in English and
  Turkish, light and dark. Pages pick the dark set with `prefers-color-scheme`.
- **Social card** (`assets/img/og.png`): rendered from the hero by `tools/og.py`.

## Before publishing

- `SITE` in `build.py` is the public address used for canonical and social
  links (`https://webbrain.one/companion` by default).
- Download links point at the GitHub release `v0.1.2` of
  `esokullu/webbrain-systray`; the CI workflow drafts that release when the tag
  is pushed. While the repository is private those links only work for people
  with access. Update `VERSION` and the file sizes in `build.py` for new
  releases.
